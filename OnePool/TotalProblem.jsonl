Contrast the telltale signs of falsehood observable in others with the speaker's conviction that the beloved's visage could never reflect such duplicity, attributing this to a divine intention that their beauty should perpetually convey love. Culminate in a reflection on the risk posed by this disconnect between the beloved's outward allure and their inner morality, invoking the biblical metaphor of Eve's apple to underscore the danger of being seduced by surface beauty that may mask a lack of true virtue.

Elaborate on how such integrity and self-control are the true markers of grace and nobility, granting these individuals a sovereignty over their essence that others lack. Introduce a metaphor comparing these virtuous beings to a summer flower, symbolizing purity and the transient nature of beauty that, while fleeting, enriches the world.
